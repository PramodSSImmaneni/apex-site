<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://youtu.be/LwRWBudOjg4">Building Your First Apache Apex Application</a> This video has a hands-on demonstration of how to check out the source code
repositories and build them, then run the maven archetype command
to generate a new Apache Apex project, populate the project with Java source files
for a new application, and finally, build and run the application -- all on a
virtual machine running Linux with Apache Hadoop installed. </p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="http://docs.datatorrent.com/tutorials/topnwords/" rel="nofollow">Top N Words Application Tutorial</a> This document provides a detailed step-by-step description of how to build and run a
word counting application with Apache Apex starting with setting up your development environment,
progressing to building, running and monitoring the application, visualizing the output and
concluding with some advanced features such as assessing operator memory requirements,
partitioning, and debugging.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="http://docs.datatorrent.com/tutorials/salesdimensions/" rel="nofollow">Sales Dimensions Application Tutorial</a> Similar to the Top N Words application but covers
dimensional computations on a simulated sales data stream.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/DataTorrent/examples" rel="nofollow">Example Applications</a> A <code>git</code> repository with sample code for specialized tutorials covering a
variety of topics such as a high-performance key-value store (HDHT), custom
partitioning using stream codecs, etc.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-apex-malhar/tree/master/demos">Malhar Demos</a> This is part of the source repository for Apache Apex Malhar and contains a number
of more substantial sample applications that developers will find especially useful.
They include an application that computes some
statistics (such as moving averages) from a live stream of stock transactions from
<strong>Yahoo! Finance</strong>; one that analyzes a synthetic stream of eruption event data for
the <strong>Old Faithful</strong> geyser; a Twitter stream analyzer; and a simulated fraud
detector.</p>

<li><p><a href="https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/13685/190407">Introducing Apache Apex</a> A webinar that begins with the historical context for the rise of Hadoop and Big Data,
discusses why the promise of Hadoop remains largely unfulfilled and why moving beyond
Map-Reduce model is essential and why operability is critically important. It continues
with a discussion of the programming model, the various components of a running application
on a YARN cluster and the large library of operators and connectors available with
Apache Apex for reading data from and writing data to external systems. Concludes with
a brief description of the visualization dashboards.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/PramodImmaneni/meetup-59089806">Stream Processing with Apache Apex</a> A broad overview slide deck covering topics such as windowing, static and dynamic

</li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/13685/194115">Fault Tolerance and Processing Semantics</a> A webinar and associated
<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ApacheApexOrganizer/webinar-fault-toleranceandprocessingsemantics">slides</a> covering core Apache Apex features including checkpointing and fault tolerance with fast,
incremental recovery via a buffer server which uses a publish-subscribe model for
inter-operator data transport. A variety of failure scenarios and processing guarantees
are discussed.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/DevendraVyavahare/windowing-in-apex">Windows in Apache Apex</a> Discusses the various flavors of windows available in Apache Apex and how to configure and
use them via callbacks. Contrasts windows with micro-batches.</p>
</li>

        <small>Apache Apex is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache Incubator. Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.</small>
